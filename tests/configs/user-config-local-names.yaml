# GLOBAL EXCLUDE AND INCLUDE OVERRIDES
# ====================================
# Override Retool and force exclude or include specific titles by adding your own
# text to match against. Items in the list are case sensitive. See the
# documentation for more information, and pay particular attention to how system
# overrides interact with global overrides.
#
# The formatting is as follows:
#
# * Plain text indicates a partial string match.
# * A prefix of / indicates a regular expression match.
# * A prefix of | indicates a full string match.
# * Additionally, wrap a string in <> to also remove any match's related clones.
#
# The text must be inside double quotes. You must escape double quotes and
# backslashes like so: \", \\
#
# Comment out lines you don't want.
exclude:
# - "[b]"
# - "/.*?\(Virtual*"

include:
# - "|My favorite title (Japan)"

# POST FILTERS

# After Retool has finished processing, remove all titles except the ones that
# match the text listed here. Items in the list are case sensitive. See the
# documentation for more information.
