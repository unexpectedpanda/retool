# LIST NAMES PREFIX AND SUFFIX
# ============================
# If the --listnames option is used, you can optionally add a prefix and
# suffix to each title.
#
# If you start a prefix with http://, https://, or ftp://, each line in the
# list will be URL encoded.
#
# The text must be inside double quotes. You must escape other double quotes
# and backslashes inside the quotes like so: \", \\
list prefix:
# - "This text will be at the start of each line"

list suffix:
# - "This text will be at the end of each line"

# ====================================
# GLOBAL EXCLUDE AND INCLUDE OVERRIDES
# ====================================
# Override Retool and force exclude or include specific titles by adding your own
# text to match against. Items in the list are case sensitive. See the
# documentation for more information, and pay particular attention to how system
# overrides interact with global overrides.
#
# The formatting is as follows:
#
# * Plain text indicates a partial string match.
# * A prefix of / indicates a regular expression match.
# * A prefix of | indicates a full string match.
# * Additionally, wrap a string in <> to also remove any match's related clones.
#
# The text must be inside double quotes. You must escape double quotes and
# backslashes like so: \", \\
#
# Comment out lines you don't want.
exclude:
# - "[b]"
# - "/.*?\(Virtual*"

include:
# - "|My favorite title (Japan)"

# ============
# POST FILTERS
# ============
# After Retool has finished processing, remove all titles except the ones that
# match the text listed here. Items in the list are case sensitive. See the
# documentation for more information.
