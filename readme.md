## What it does

Retool converts [Redump](http://redump.org/) and [No-Intro](https://www.no-intro.org/)
dats to 1G1R, doing a better job than dat managers with parent/clone dats. It
has both GUI and CLI versions.

You'll still need a dat manager to use the files Retool creates, such as
[CLRMamePro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/), [RomVault](https://www.romvault.com/),
or [Romcenter](https://www.romcenter.com/) &mdash; you just won't need to use their 1G1R
modes, as Retool will have already done the work for you.

You can learn more about how it works, and how to use it in the [wiki](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool/wiki/).

## Why not use CLRMAMEPro or Romcenter's 1G1R mode with a parent/clone dat?

The short version:

Dat managers don't do a great job of picking canonical 1G1R titles, and No-Intro
often misses clones in their dats.

The long version:

Historically if you wanted to create a 1G1R set, you'd use a parent/clone dat in
combination with a dat manager like CLRMAMEPro or Romcenter. After loading the
dat into the dat manager, you'd set your desired regions and region order, and
whether or not to filter by languages (assuming the dat has `<release>` tags
properly set up &mdash; something which is vanishingly rare). You'd then trust
the dat manager to choose the perfect parent title for you from your favorite
region, discarding the clones from other regions.

Here's the thing. The parent/clone dat format was created for
[MAME](https://www.mamedev.org), to enable one of the ways in which it organizes
its ROMs. A "parent" ROM in MAME contains the base or common files for a game,
while "clone" ROMs contains only files that are different from the parent. If
you load a clone game in MAME, it's smart enough to load the base files from the
parent, and any of the modified files it needs from the clone.

Dat manager 1G1R is effectively a hack on top of this system. In 1G1R mode a dat
manager uses the parent/clone relationships in a dat to set up a group of
related titles. It then selects a single title from that group based on your
region and language preferences and ignores the other titles, in an effort to
only include the most desired version. While on the surface this seems
reasonable, if you look a little closer you start to see the cracks.

The primary issue is that dat managers and parent/clone dats don't have an
expansive concept of title priority. For example, what happens when there are
two copies of the same title from the same region, but they have different
names? Or different version numbers? Or were published by different companies at
different times? Which title does the dat manager choose then? The answer
&mdash; the first one it finds, _not_ the newest or best.

There's another issue, and that concerns languages. To determine a 1G1R title,
dat managers give each title a score, combined from your region and language
priority. While selected regions are treated as a filter (don't include Europe,
and you won't get European titles), languages aren't. Instead, languages are
treated as a "bonus" score added to the original region score, meaning you can
end up with titles in languages you don't want if a region is high enough
priority. Check out [LogiqX's pseudo code](https://forum.no-intro.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=544)
for an idea of how this works (search for "I do this kind of thing for a
living..." to find the relevant bit).

Retool handles proper 1G1R title selection, and a whole lot more. It even
identifies the languages of each title by using multiple sources &mdash; the
implied language spoken in the region the title is from, languages explicitly
listed in the title's filename, and languages listed on Redump's website and
No-Intro's database, which aren't always included in the filenames.

After you set up the GUI or `user-config.yaml` to your liking, Retool's output
is already 1G1R, meaning you don't need to select 1G1R mode, regions, or
languages in your dat manager &mdash; just load the dat and go.


## Download and installation

How you download and install Retool will depend on your level of comfort with
code.

### For Windows users only familiar with graphical interfaces
You can get going in a few easy steps:

1. Download the [latest binary](https://unexpectedpanda.github.io/files/retool-latest-win-x86-64.zip)
   for Windows.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choosing.
3. Double click `retool-gui.exe`. It will show a Command Prompt window, then the
   GUI will load. Don't close the Command Prompt window as it'll close the GUI
   as well. It also serves a useful purpose &mdash; it shows you the output of
   the program when you're processing a dat file.
4. Click **File > Check for clone list updates** to download the latest clone
   lists and metadata.

### For those familiar with Git and Python
Clone Retool from this repo and run it with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Retool requires a minimum of Python 3.8, and needs additional modules to be
installed.

To install the modules, assuming you already have Python installed, open
Terminal, Command Prompt, or whatever the CLI is on your system, and type:

```shell
pip install bs4 lxml strictyaml pysimpleguiqt
```

On systems that have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you might need to run `pip3`
instead of `pip`.

### Linux

If you get a libxcb error in Linux when launching `retool-gui.py`, this fixed
the problem for me in Ubuntu 20.04:

```
sudo apt-get install libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-xtest0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev
```

## Clone lists

While Retool is smart enough to automatically match certain types of parents and
clones, there are certain situations that require manual assignment, like when
a title has a different name in different regions. To achieve this, Retool keeps
[clone lists](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool/wiki/Clone-lists).

At the time of writing, Retool's clone lists are the most thorough that I know
of. I manually combed through titles in most dats, and cross referenced them on
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org), [Moby Games](https://www.mobygames.com),
[Retroplace](https://www.retroplace.com), [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com),
[VDGB](https://vgdb.io), [VGM](https://www.video-games-museum.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com),
[Amazon.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp), [PlayAsia](https://www.play-asia.com/),
[Sega Retro](https://segaretro.org/), [PSCX2 Wiki](https://wiki.pcsx2.net),
[PlayStation DataCenter](https://psxdatacenter.com/), [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net),
[The PC Engine Software Bible](http://www.pcengine.co.uk/), [The World of CDI](https://www.theworldofcdi.com),
[SMS Power](https://www.smspower.org/) and [Atari Mania](http://www.atarimania.com).
I checked out the parent/clone dats for No-Intro, and occasionally I went through Redump's
site for Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Chinese characters for titles, so I could do
translations and find out what they were called in other languages. When all
else failed, I did some good old web searching in order to turn up information.
At some point I discovered [FilterQuest](https://github.com/UnluckyForSome/FilterQuest),
a similar tool, and added some missing titles from there.

There have also been plenty of community contributions, from those who have
[filed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool/issues).

Clone lists are updated independently of the program, and are formatted as JSON
files. They are stored in a subfolder called `clonelists`, which is in the same
folder as Retool.

You can update them from the GUI using the **File** menu, by running
`updateclonelists.py`, or by downloading them yourself from this repository.

# Clonerel

Clonerel is a CLI program that generates an Excel file from any parent/clone
dat file. It helps you more easily visualize parent/clone relationships
in the dat, and track down titles that haven't been assigned parents yet.

You can create a parent/clone dat file in Retool by using the `-x` option, or
by selecting **Export dat in legacy parent/clone format** in the GUI.


## Installation

Clonerel uses openpyxl to generate an Excel file. You'll need at least OpenPyxl
v3.03 to avoid a fun crash bug. Install it and other dependencies with `pip`.

```shell
pip install openpyxl bs4 lxml
```

## Usage

```shell
python clonerel.py <input dat>
```
