# Retool

Retool is a filter utility for [Redump](http://www.redump.org/) and [No-Intro](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download)
DAT files. By customizing the DAT files before you load them into a ROM manager, you can more
effectively trim, consolidate, and deduplicate your ROM sets.

Retool offers the following features:

* [Superior One Game, One ROM (1G1R) functionality compared to other tools](retool-1g1r).

* Priority-based region and language filtering.

* Exclusions of unwanted title types like demos, applications, and more.

* Regular expression filters for including or excluding titles.

* CLI and GUI versions.

You feed Retool an input DAT file, and it creates a new DAT from it with all your
preferences, leaving the original intact. You can then load the new DAT in a ROM manager
like [CLRMamePro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/),
[RomVault](https://www.romvault.com/), or
[Romcenter](https://www.romcenter.com/) to do your file management &mdash; you just don't
need to use their 1G1R modes, as Retool has already done the work for you.
